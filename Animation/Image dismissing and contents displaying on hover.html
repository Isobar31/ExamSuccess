            <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement
              complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there
              and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content
              updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
              etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
